# GitHub Desktop Helper

This is just a small program I wrote to help my teammates with Git. 
**:warning: Warning: Everything is hardcoded into the program. Certain tasks may happen seemingly randomly, such as fetching, sleeping computer, etc.** That being said, feel free to take the source code and modify it to your liking. Just remember to remove the auto update portion.

## Features
- Git
	- All fetched content is automatically pulled
	- All commited content is automatically pushed
	- Reminds you to fetch/commit at different points.
	- Automatically fetches at certian times.
- Other
	- Automatically checks for updates and downloads them (very important since there are many computers and I don't want to have to go around to each computer to update the software.

## Download Instructions
**Remember: I would not follow these instructions since the program is hardcoded specifically for my team.** Just use this for reference if you want to modify the source code yourself.

1. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/timothymhuang/githelper/releases/latest)
2. Download GitHelper.Installer.Exe
3. Place this executable inside your local git repository. This will tell it what repository to monitor. You can delete the installer after.
4. Run the installer. The other files will automatically download into your appdata folder, and an auto-startup file will be generated.
